<p>This page discusses several questions that are often asked by our
users.</p>


<h2>Is using RobOptim slower than implementing directly my problem?</h2>

<p>RobOptim takes great care to not slow down the optimization
process. However, it greatly depends on the complexity of your
problem: if you have a very small or linear problem, the cost of the
infrastructure may appear. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copies are made between RobOptim and the underlying solvers for
  technical reasons such as memory alignment and Eigen (former)
  limitations. Other Copies may have to be done to decouple the solver
  data from the RobOptim problem. This could be solved in the future
  by using Eigen new <code>Ref</code> feature.</li>

  <li><code>impl_compute</code>, <code>impl_gradient</code>, etc. are
  virtual functions and hence their call is slightly slower than with
  non-virtual functions.</li>

  <li>RobOptim stores meta-information about the problem (function
  titles, sizes, etc.) and may need to allocate more memory than a
  custom-made program. Additional time spent in allocation routines,
  cache miss, loss of memory locality induced by additional allocation
  may cause the optimization to run slower in particular
  cases. However, stable RobOptim components takes great care of never
  allocating memory during the optimization process.</li>
</ul>


Additionally, the use of RobOptim filters, logging, finite
differentiation may lead to slow resolution. All these previously
mentioned features are optional and not always provided by sovlers.


<h3>Example: profiling of Inverse Kinematics problem resolution
through optimization</h3>


<p>A typical RobOptim application may be to compute the configuration
of a robotic arm so that its end-effector reaches a particular
position in the operational space (Euclidian space). The following
screenshot shows the output of KCacheGrind after solving the problem
100 times for 100 different reachable positions chosen randomly. For
simplicity, the optimization problem is rebuilt from scratch at each
time so 100000 optimization problems are built in this case.</p>

    <p>KCacheGrind displays the Callee Map of the <code>main</code>
      function. On the Callee Map, each function called by the "main"
      function is displayed. The area of each box matches the time
      spent in each function. Data are generated using Valgrind
      callgrind tool on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin (64-bits),
      GCC 4.6.3.
    </p>

    <p>The two large blocks are calls to
    the <code>ql0002_</code>. This function is internal to the solver
    used in this case (CFSQP) and do not call any code from
    RobOptim. <small>Click to enlarge the picture.</small></p>

<ul>

  <li>84% of the total execution time is spent in one function of the
    solver. RobOptim cannot have any impact on the run-time of this
    function as no code from the framework is used at this point. The
    remaining 16% gathers problem creation, display, solver
    initialization and RobOptim run-time cost.</li>

  <li>The most time consuming RobOptim related function
    is <code>array_to_vector</code>, it only represents 0.42% of the
    total execution time.</li>

  <li>99% of the time is spent in the <code>solve</code> function
  indicating that problem definition in RobOptim is reasonable
  efficient.</li>

</ul>

<p>Profiling data shows that RobOptim does not decrease optimization
efficiency. The infrastructure code is efficient and rarely
called. The checks are efficiently disabled and optimized out in
release mode. Building the problem may be more efficient without
RobOptim but is fast enough even when RobOptim is used. Furthermore,
problem building is a one-time cost.</p>

<p>If you experience a lack of efficiency while using RobOptim, check
you are compiling in release mode. Binary packages are always built
this way. You should also pass the appropriate flag to your own
project (i.e. <code>-DNDEBUG -O3</code>). Your experience may also
vary depending on the solver you use. Younger, unstable, solvers may
be slower as they may copy uselessly data around or do not use the
solver API in the most efficient way. Check
the <a href="solvers.html">solvers page</a> and look for stable,
matures solvers bridges.</p>
